Use Jquery's animation methods to set up a faster
system of moving cards - perhaps stop() and finish().
Right now everything uses the table as a Queue,
which means that only one animation can happen at
a time.

When moving multiple cards at a time, as seen in the
example I made, the deque sequence makes it so that
only the last card moves normally and the ones before
it move quickly.

Also, cards don't change their orientation when
moving to a pile with a different facing setting.
This is due to them not getting checked when they are
added to the new pile DIV.
